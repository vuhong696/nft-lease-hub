# 🏡 NFTLeaseHub – Rentify Protocol

**NFTLeaseHub** redefines property rentals by integrating blockchain and NFT technologies to build a transparent, efficient, and decentralized rental ecosystem.

At the heart of the platform is **Rentify**, a protocol that enables property owners to tokenize real estate rental rights into unique, transferable NFTs. These NFTs represent access to specific properties for defined periods and can be listed, leased, or transferred via a secure, peer-to-peer marketplace.
